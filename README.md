# Data_Analysis_Dashboard-Excel-INJURY-DATASET-
This dashboard summarizes workplace injuries across departments and time, showing 514 incidents and ₹717.8K in costs. Most incidents involve employees and contractors, with higher injury rates in morning and afternoon shifts. Departments like Making and Painting show consistent trends, and males account for more lost workdays.

# OBJECTIVE

To analyze workplace injury data across locations, departments, shifts, and genders in order to identify trends, incident types, and cost impacts. The goal is to uncover key risk areas, monitor incident rates, and provide actionable insights to improve safety, reduce expenditure, and minimize lost workdays.

# Questions (KPIs)

1. Total number of incidents.

2. What is the total number of expenditure on incidents?

3. How are incident costs distributed across different cities (Bangalore, Delhi, etc.)?

4. Which city had the highest/lowest expenditure on incidents?

5. Which department had the highest incident costs?

6. What is the incident rate trend over time (increasing, stable, or decreasing)?

7. Are there specific departments or locations that require safety interventions?

# Steps

1. Data Preparation - Standardized formats for costs, dates, and categorical fields. Categorized data by department, location, gender, and shifts for analysis.

2. Dashboard Creation - Built interactive visuals in Excel using Pivot Tables, Charts, and Slicers. Created KPIs for Total Incidents and Total Expenditure.

3. Analysis by Dimensions-

   -> Yearly Trend Analysis: Compared incident costs across 2020–2022.
   
   -> Location Analysis: Identified top cities contributing to expenditure.
   
   -> Departmental Analysis: Evaluated cost variations across departments.
   
   -> Incident Type Analysis: Tracked frequency of incidents (burns, slips, equipment failures, etc.).
   
   -> Shift & Gender Analysis: Assessed lost workdays by gender and shift.

5. Interpretation & Insights- Drew conclusions on risk areas, cost drivers, and workforce impact.Suggested measures for reducing incidents, improving safety, and lowering costs.

# CONCLUSION

The analysis highlights that workplace injuries have resulted in 514 incidents with a total expenditure of ₹717.8K over the given period. Costs have generally declined from 2020 to 2022, indicating improvement in safety measures, though certain departments and shifts continue to show higher costs. Overall, while progress is evident in cost reduction, the insights suggest that department-specific safety training, stricter compliance, and shift-based monitoring can further minimize incidents, reduce expenditure, and improve workplace safety.
